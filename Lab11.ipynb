    "\n",
    "Evolution is a natural process that over time hones the form and function of a population to the environment in which it lives.  So, in some sense what evolution is doing is solving the problem of finding a group of individuals that are well suited to their environments.  Given that view, it isn't a big leap to imagine using a simulation of evolution to find a collection of good solutions (individuals) to a problem (environment).  This is a powerful idea that computer scientists have called a *genetic algorithm* and has been used successfully applied to [a wide range of real-world problems](https://www.brainz.org/15-real-world-applications-genetic-algorithms/).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab you will be using Python code to create a *genetic algorithm* that simulates evolution. You will apply your algorithm to a problem that while a little contrived illustrates the power of the approach. Hopefully this experience will both improve your understanding of how evolution works and give you some insight into how *genetic algorithms* can be used as a problem solving tool."

    "### Evolutionary Structures and Processes\n",
    "\n",
    "In natural evolution *genes* encode the basic form and function of an *individual*.  The individuals in a *population* compete with each other to reproduce and create *offspring*.  For example, they compete for the resources to survive until reaching reproductive age and in species that reproduce sexually they compete for reproductive partners.  This competition makes it so that the better suited an individual is to its environment (Can it live long enough? Is it attractive to a mate?) the greater its chances of producing offspring through *reproduction*.  This is what Charles Darwin referred to as \"survival of the fittest.\" He meant not that a particular fit individual would survive, but rather that the individuals best suited to their environment (i.e. those with high *fitness*) will tend to reproduce more frequently. Thus, the genes (and associated traits) that confer fitness to individuals will survive by being passed on to offspring through reproduction. It is this unconscious competitive *selection* of the fittest individuals as the parents of the next *generation* of offspring that, over time, hones the form and function of a population to suit its environment."

    "\n",
    "In natural evolution genes are part of a DNA string. The value of a gene, its *allele*, is represented as a string of [A's, C's, G's and T's](https://www.genome.gov/genetics-glossary/acgt) where the letters indicate the sequence of the *bases* adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G), and thymine (T).  The structure of DNA and that it uses these four bases is a product of our physical word.  When simulating evolution in a computer we have no such constraints and can create our own *virtual DNA* using whatever set of *bases* we like.  Thus, we are free to choose a set of bases for our virtual DNA that matches the problem we are trying to solve.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if we are trying to:\n",
    "  - [design a new molecule](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1021928016359) for a particular purpose we might use chemical symbols as our alphabet.  \n",
    "  - [find the best aerodynamic shape](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0954406217700181) for a car we might use numbers indicating the coefficients of an equation as our alphabet.  \n",
    "  - [compose music](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/11539902_158) we might use musical notes as our alphabet.\n",
    "  \n",
    "The test problem we will use in this lab is to use evolution to find the sequence of letters that compose lines from Shakespearian sonnets. For example:\n",
    "  - Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?\n",
    "  - To me, fair friend, you never can be old,\n",
    "  - From fairest creatures we desire increase,\n",
    "\n",
    "To keep it simple we will assume when running the program that the target line is all uppercase has had all of its punctuation removed. For example:\n",
    "  - SHALL I COMPARE THEE TO A SUMMERS DAY\n",
    "  - TO ME FAIR FRIEND YOU NEVER CAN BE OLD\n",
    "  - FROM FAIREST CREATURES WE DESIRE INCREASE\n",
